# This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project has as purpose the application of my new knowledge in React and Redux, that has as functionality to be a Journal app.

Basically consists of a journal where you can place notes and upload files from your computer, being able to create a user or logging directly with your google account and was stylized with **Sass**

In the not so distant future I will add good styles to be a more pleasant application to the public eye, while I will continue my studies with React.

If you want you can see the app in the following [link](https://journal-app-test.netlify.app/auth/login).

# **Note**:

Only the authentication part does not work with google due to the permissions of github pages
